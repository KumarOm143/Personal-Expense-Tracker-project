# Personal Expense Tracker

## Overview
The **Personal Expense Tracker** is a Python program that helps users track their daily spending. You can add expenses, organize them by category (like Food, Transport, etc.), and view summaries by day or category. The program saves all expenses to a file, so you can access them later.

## Features
- **Add Daily Expenses**: Record your expenses with date, category, description, and amount.
- **Organize by Category**: Categorize your expenses (e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment).
- **View Summaries**: View total expenses by a specific date or category.
- **Save Data**: All expense data is stored in a text file, so you can see your records after closing the program.
- **Error Handling**: The program will ask you to correct mistakes like wrong date formats or non-numeric amounts.

## How to Use in PyCharm
1. **Clone or download** the project files onto your computer.
2. **Open PyCharm** and create a new project or open the existing project.
3. **Add the project files** (like `expense_tracker.py` and `expenses.txt`) to your PyCharm project folder.
4. **Run the program**:
   - Right-click `expense_tracker.py`.
   - Click **Run 'expense_tracker'**.
5. In the **Run console**, you'll see a menu with options:
   - **1. Add a New Expense**: Add daily expenses.
   - **2. View Summary by Date**: View expenses for a specific day.
   - **3. View Summary by Category**: View expenses for a specific category.
   - **4. Exit**: Save your expenses and exit the program.
